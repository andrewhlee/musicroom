			<h1>Andrew</h1> <br>
			<p>Andrew Belle is a Chicago-based singer-songwriter. He released his debut album, The Ladder, in 2010 and released its follow up, Black Bear, in 2013. Andrew was presented a John Lennon Songwriting award in 2009 and is currently part of the critically acclaimed national touring group Ten Out Of Tenn.</p>

			   <br><br><br><br>

			<h1>"Pieces"</h1> <br>
			<p>"I wrote the song for my wife not too long after we got married in Chicago last summer. I knew I had to sit down and write this new record but was struggling to find ideas or inspiration for it, and so this was the one that kind of got the ball rolling for me.

			<br><br>

			The chorus says, 'I love you, I love you â€” and all of your pieces,' which was something I had almost accidentally said to her one night and afterward went in the other room and wrote it down. I found this crazy-sounding synth sound on my keyboard and the whole thing came together in an hour or two."<br><br>- Andrew Belle</p>
