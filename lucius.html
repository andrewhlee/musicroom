			<h1>Lucious</h1> <br>
			<p>Sometimes, when two voices come together, the result can be arresting. That's what Holly Laessig and Jess Wolfe discovered when they met at the Berklee College of Music in Boston and struck up the partnership that would become Lucius. The band is a quintet, with Laessig and Wolfe's voices at the center â€” and the music they make together can sound like anything from 1960's girl groups to sunbaked psychedelia to the hangover that comes after after a heavy-drinking country song.</p>

			   <br><br><br><br>

			<h1>Fun Fact</h1> <br>
			<p><i>Taken from an interview...</i>
			<br><br>
			LAESSIG: I mean, we both had kind of a tough time growing up and in school - not really being accepted or getting along, or finding the friends that you wish you had. And so when we found each other and some of the other friends that we met in college, it was a really great experience. And we kind of wanted to just celebrate that and have other people feel that, too.
			<br><br>
			RATH: So you guys met at the Berklee College of Music, right?
			<br><br>
			WOLFE: We did. We had a lot of mutual friends in school and one drunken night, started talking about our influences and realized how similar they were and - even though we had completely different upbringings. Holly grew up in Cleveland, Ohio; and I grew up in Los Angeles. But there was just an automatic kinship. And we started writing together very soon after that.</p>
