			<h1>Thrice</h1> <br>
			<p>Thrice is a band from Irvine, California, which formed in 1998. It was
			   founded by Dustin Kensrue and Teppei Teranishi while they were in high
			   school. Known for their hard music with distorted guitars, Thrice also
			   experimented with electronic sounds and nuanced songwriting. They ended
			   with their last album with a refined combination of all the experiments 
			   and explorations.</p>

			<h1>"Anthology"</h1> <br>
			<p>"Let me think. I went thought a couple versions before I settled on what I 
			was going to do with it. I was really not sure about the whole idea for a while. 
			I didn’t know if it was cheesy. I thought there was a cool aspect to it, but it’s 
			hard to tell being inside of creating it how it’s going to be perceived. I 
			remember listening to the soft ballad on the last Pearl Jam record, Backspacer. 
			It’s a really sweet song, in the sense that it’s very open and not guarded. 
			I remember listening to it and feeling like, “Yeah, this is working. I like it. 
			There’s something endearing and inviting about it.” That kind of pushed me to 
			finish the song the way I was writing it as this love song but also a compilation 
			of all these other love songs that I had done. It wasn’t meant to note some sense 
			of finality, but I see how people could get that out of it." <br><br>- Dustin Kensrue</p>
